\begin_layout Section
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In principle, we have achieved what we set out to; we were able to understand
 how BM explains PM, a test of contextuality.
 Having clarified various concepts through the heavy machinery of BM, here
 we attempt to further our understanding without using BM.
 We will start with refining the assumptions of the PM test.
 We will see how, when one of the assumptions is refined, one version holds
 for QM.
 The other is not even experimentally testable.
 Thereafter, we construct simple toy models, one of which is unambiguously
 non-contextual (unlike BM, where one must restrict the measurement process
 to make the same claim).
 This is used to demonstrate the distinction between the two versions of
 multiplicativity.
 We then generalize this toy model to produce statistics consistent with
 QM, for an arbitrary, but discrete Hilbert space.
 Finally, we generalize this to continuous variables (without spins) and
 obtain a consistent one-dimensional completion of QM.
 Its relation with other known completions (BM & RS) is also discussed.
 This model aims to facilitate easy value assignments in case of the phase
 space versions of determinism and contextuality tests.
 These are hard to compute from BM and RS.

Multiplicativity

\begin_layout Standard
Let us recall two assumptions from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Peres-Mermin-Revisited"

\end_inset

, that of non invasiveness and multiplicativity.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots,\hat{B}_{n}$
\end_inset

 be a set of commuting observables and also let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}(\hat{*})$
\end_inset

 represent the value assigned to an operator.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 occurs multiple times in a given expression, then 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 encodes the sequence of measurements.
 If we assume non-invasiveness, then multiplicativity has a clear meaning;
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition*
In a Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, a map 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\to$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, is 
\emph on
multiplicative
\emph default
 iff 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{1}(f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n}))=f(m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1}),m_{1}(\hat{B}_{2}),\dots m_{1}(\hat{B}_{n})).\label{eq:multiplicativity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we have generalized the notion from simply a product to any arbitrary
 function.
 We have used 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 as the subscript for each 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 since in this case, the sequence of a measurement is irrelevant.
 If one relaxes the no-disturbance assumption, then the following also becomes
 a possibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition*
In a Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, a map 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\to$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, is 
\emph on
sequentially-multiplicative
\emph default
 iff 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{1}(f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots,\hat{B}_{n}))=f(m_{k_{1}}(\hat{B}_{1}),m_{k_{2}}(\hat{B}_{2}),\dots m_{k_{n}}(\hat{B}_{n})),\label{eq:seqMultiplicativity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}\equiv(k_{1},k_{2},\dots k_{n})\in\{(1,2,3,\dots n),(2,1,3,\dots n),$
\end_inset

 + all permutations
\begin_inset Formula $\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We take a moment to understand the meaning of these statements more carefully,
 in the context of QM.
 Consider the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\chi\right\rangle =\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1}\equiv\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{2}\equiv\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}\equiv f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2})=\hat{B}_{1}\hat{B}_{2}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1}$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 with equal probabilities, and so does a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 is guaranteed to yield 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 QM can't explicitly contradict 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:multiplicativity"

\end_inset

 since it only yields probabilities.
 Further, a measurement in QM leads to disturbance, unless of course we
 consider simultaneous eigenstates.
 Therefore, after making a measurement, say 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1})$
\end_inset

, one can't obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Even if we agree to start the measurement with the same state, we can't
 make the hidden variables identical.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:seqMultiplicativity"

\end_inset

 is certainly testable in QM, for one can first measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1}$
\end_inset

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1})$
\end_inset

, then measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{2}$
\end_inset

, to find 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}(\hat{B}_{2})$
\end_inset

 and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1})m_{2}(\hat{B}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Starting from the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\chi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 again, one can measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C})$
\end_inset

 which has a precise value in this case.
 One may again claim that experimentally, there maybe some hidden variables
 which can't be made identical and thus after measuring the 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

s, it is impossible to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C})$
\end_inset

.
 This difficulty is circumvented in this case, by the fact that regardless
 of the value of the hidden variable, given 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\chi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

, the measurement outcome is certain.
 Thus, taking the same state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\chi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is enough.
 One can check, from all the possibilities, if 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1})m_{2}(\hat{B}_{2})=m_{1}(\hat{C})$
\end_inset

.
 We tried looking for states and operators that would violate this condition,
 but failed.
 Infact, as we will prove momentarily, 
\emph on
QM weakly enforces sequentially multiplicative
\emph default
.
 However, since restoring the hidden variables is not possible in general,
 
\emph on
QM doesn't enforce multiplicativity
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We worked out two proofs of weak sequential multiplicativity in QM.
 The first was a restricted, brute force proof.
 The second we showed holds in general, which we will discuss here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition*
Let the system be in a state, s.t.
 measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 yields repeatable results (same result each time).
 Then according to QM, sequential multiplicativity (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:seqMultiplicativity"

\end_inset

) holds, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}\equiv f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n})$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are as defined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assume without loss of generality that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n}$
\end_inset

 are mutually compatible (commuting) and complete set of operators.
 If say for instance the set is not complete, then one can add the missing
 operators and label them as aforesaid.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{1}^{(l_{1})},b_{2}^{(l_{2})},\dots b_{n}^{(l_{n})}\right)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle =b_{i}^{(l_{i})}\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}$
\end_inset

 indexes the eigenvalues corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\mathbf{b}}\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle \left\langle \mathbf{b}\right|=\hat{\mathbb{I}}$
\end_inset

.
 Let the state of the system be given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and it must be s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}\left|\psi\right\rangle =c\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, by assumption.
 For the statement to follow, one need only show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 must be made of only those 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

s, which satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $c=f(b_{1}^{(l_{1})},b_{2}^{(l_{2})},\dots b_{n}^{(l_{n})})$
\end_inset

.
 This is the crucial step.
 Proving this is so is trivial.
 We start with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}\left|\psi\right\rangle =c\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and take its inner product with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{b}\right|$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \mathbf{b}\right|\hat{C}\left|\psi\right\rangle  & = & c\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle ,\\
\left\langle \mathbf{b}\right|f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n})\left|\psi\right\rangle  & = & c\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle ,\\
f(b_{1}^{(l_{1})},b_{2}^{(l_{2})},\dots b_{n}^{(l_{n})})\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle  & = & c\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle .
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Also, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\sum_{\mathbf{b}}\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle \left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, from completeness.
 If we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

s for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

, then we can conclude that indeed 
\begin_inset Formula $c=f(b_{1}^{(l_{1})},b_{2}^{(l_{2})},\dots b_{n}^{(l_{n})})$
\end_inset

.
 However, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

s that are orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then nothing can be said.
 We can thus conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is made only of those 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

s that satisfy the required relation.
 That completes the proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we can't enforce sequential multiplicativity in general, because
 of the hidden variable resetting objection that arises, which was discussed
 with the example.
 However, in the PM case, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are just 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\hat{\mathbb{I}}$
\end_inset

, it follows that all states are their eigenstates.
 Consequently, for these operators, sequential multiplicativity must always
 hold.
 With the two notions well defined, we now proceed with constructing two
 simple models, which don't satisfy the non-invasive assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Simple Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We aim to distinguish the notion of contextuality and multiplicativity by
 means of two simple models.
 These will not reproduce the statistics as predicted by QM, but serve as
 examples and are generalized later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contextual, Memory Model
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Contextual,-Memory-Model"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Memory Model presented here, is perhaps the simplest contextual model.
 It is also non-multiplicative and invasive, viz.
 it doesn't satisfy any of (1), (2) and (3), as listed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Peres-Mermin-Revisited"

\end_inset

.
 The model is assumed to be sequentially multiplicative
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
infact according to QM, for row and column measurements, sequential multiplicati
vity is a requirement
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and the assignments are made iteratively through the following algorithm.
 We assume that the system has a matrix that can store values and has a
 memory that can store the last 3 operators that were measured.
 Initially assume that the matrix has all entries equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 The algorithm is that (i) upon measurement of an observable, yield the
 value as saved in the matrix, (ii) append the observable in the 3 element
 memory and (iii) update the matrix, once the context is known, to satisfy
 the PM conditions on the rows and columns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us take a quick example to understand how things are working.
 Assume we start with measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{33}$
\end_inset

.
 The system will yield 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{A}_{33})=1$
\end_inset

, in accordance with the values stored initially (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:memoryAssignments"

\end_inset

).
 The memory at this stage would read 
\begin_inset Formula $\{*,*,\hat{A}_{33}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the context is not yet known, the matrix is left unchanged.
 Say the next operator measured is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{23}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}(\hat{A}_{23})=1$
\end_inset

, and the memory would be updated to 
\begin_inset Formula $\{*,\hat{A}_{33},\hat{A}_{23}\}$
\end_inset

.
 The context is now known, and we update the matrix to ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C})=m_{1}(A_{33})m_{2}(A_{23})m_{3}(A_{13})=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Since the first measurements yielded 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

, we update the matrix so that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{3}(A_{13})=-1$
\end_inset

 to finally obtain the correct PM constraint.
 This has been summarized by the following equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{1}(\hat{A}_{ij})=m_{2}(\hat{A}_{ij})\doteq\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right],\,m_{3}(\hat{A}_{ij})\doteq\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & -1\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right].\label{eq:memoryAssignments}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The reader can convince her(him)self that the assignments are indeed consistent,
 regardless of which row/column is measured.
 There are two remarks which need to be made.
 First, note this model is not multiplicative since 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{A}_{33})m_{1}(\hat{A}_{23})m_{1}(\hat{A}_{13})=1\neq m_{1}(\hat{C})=-1$
\end_inset

, by construction.
 Second, observe that the value assigned to the observables, depends explicitly
 on the context, thus the model is contextual.

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now discuss another simple model, which is non-contextual and still consisten
t with QM.
 It is also non-multiplicative and invasive, viz.
 assumption (1) holds, but (2) and (3) don't, as listed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Peres-Mermin-Revisited"

\end_inset

.
 Reference to the PM square will be made, and it has been reproduced, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{A}_{ij}\doteq\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x} & \hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}} & \hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}\\
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}} & \hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y} & \hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}\\
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x} & \hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y} & \hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}
\end{array}\right],
\]

\end_inset

for convenience.
 The assignments are made by a three step process.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \quad{}
\end_inset

1.
 Initial State: Choose an appropriate initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (say 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Newline newline

2.
 Hidden Variable (HV): Toss a coin and assign

 for heads, else assign 
\begin_inset Formula $c=-1$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \quad{}
\end_inset

3.
 Predictions/Assignments: For an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}'\in\{\hat{A}_{ij},\hat{R}_{i},\hat{C}_{j}\,(\forall\,i,j)\}$
\end_inset

 check if 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}'\left|\psi\right\rangle =\lambda\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, then assign 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 as the value.
 Else, assign 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So far, the model has only predicted the outcomes of measurements.
 If however, a measurement is made on the system, then although we know
 the result from the predictions, we must update the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of the system, depending on which observable is measured and arrive at
 new predictions, using the aforesaid steps.
 The following final step fills precisely this gap.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \quad{}
\end_inset

4.
 Update: Say 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 was observed.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 is s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\lambda\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then leave the state unchanged.
 Else, find 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{\pm}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

), s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}\left|p_{\pm}\right\rangle =\pm\left|p_{\pm}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and update the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle \to\left|p_{c}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us explicitly apply the aforesaid algorithm, to the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Say we obtained tails, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $c=-1$
\end_inset

.
 To arrive at the assignments, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is an eigenket of only 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{i},\hat{C}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{33}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, in the first iteration, all these should be assigned their respective
 eigenvalues.
 The remaining operators must be assigned 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:toyModel"

\end_inset

).
 Two remarks are in order.
 First, this model is 
\emph on
non
\emph default
-multiplicative, for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C}_{3})=-1\neq m_{1}(\hat{A}_{13})m_{1}(\hat{A}_{23})m_{1}(\hat{A}_{33})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Second, we must impose sequential multiplicativity as a consistency check
 of the model, which in particular entails that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C}_{3})=m_{1}(\hat{A}_{33})m_{2}(\hat{A}_{23})m_{3}(\hat{A}_{13})$
\end_inset

.
 To illustrate this, we must choose to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{33}$
\end_inset

.
 According to step 4 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{33}$
\end_inset

, the final state remains 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

For the next iteration, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=2$
\end_inset

, say we again yield 
\begin_inset Formula $c=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is also unchanged, the assignment remains invariant.
 For the final step, we choose to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}=\hat{A}_{23}(=\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y})$
\end_inset

, to proceed with sequentially measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}_{3}$

 To simplify calculations, we note

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{\pm}\right\rangle =\left|0\right\rangle \pm i\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{y}$
\end_inset

).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is manifestly not an eigenket of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

, we must find 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{-}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $c=-1$
\end_inset

.
 It is immediate that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{-}\right\rangle =\left(\left|\tilde{+}\tilde{-}\right\rangle +\left|\tilde{-}\tilde{+}\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}=\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 Let's check that.

\begin_inset Formula $m_{3}(\hat{A}_{13})=1$

 indeed.
 As a remark, it maybe emphasised that the

\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}(\hat{A}_{23})=m_{3}(\hat{A}_{23})$

We can clearly see that the assignment is non-contextual since given an

 The assignment is non-multiplicative, because this scheme when applied

 the statistics).
 We have already seen explicitly that the toy-model non-multiplicative.
 The theory is, of course, invasive as the state is updated after each measureme

 Now the cumulative of this can be quickly constructed, and where the

 At some later time if the Gaussian shifts (assume it had some momentum),
 then for the same value of

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Reasoning similar to the previous subsection entails that this theory is
 also non-multiplicative and non-contextual.
\end_layout

The theory is explicitly non-contextual since values are uniquely assigned
 to operators, given 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 However, one needs more analysis to extend this to multiple particles.
 Once that is accomplished, one must show that measuring the observables
 using the Hamiltonian approach, would yield results consistent with those
 obtained from the postulates of the theory.
 To show then that the theory is non-contextual, one would be required to
 show that all concievable measurement schemes would produce the same result,
 else, like BM, this theory wouldn't be able to predict the values of operators
 with only the state and hidden variable information.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
[TODO: write this section properly; the main idea is that to be consistent
 with the method of measuring arbitrary observables, by position measurements,
 one can't assign values in the aforesaid way.
 This way, you end up with two assignments for the same observable and have
 to accept eventually, that the result you get would depend on the experiment
 that is performed and then there's no meaning one can assign to an observable
 having a value; thus if I assign a value to position, then effectively
 all my remaining freedom is lost.
 Thus, one would have to restrict the theory in some, which is ok for spins,
 black box the other degree of freedom, but here one can't do this.

\end_layout

\end_inset

Once extended appropriately, this theory would effectively overcome all
 the challenges we had for testing the continuous variable extensions of
 the GHZ and contextuality tests.
 Predictions of observables will be straight forward.
 To obtain values from BM, one had to do a detailed analysis, for RS, evaluating
 values of observables other than 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (even 
\begin_inset Formula $q+p$

 is hard) was hard.

We had this hunch however, that the trajectory so obtained, must be identical
 to Bohmian trajectories.
 This infact turns out to be so.
 Let us take a moment to prove this, for using the same method, one can
 evalute a trajectory for the momentum also.
 This would be distinct from the momentum in BM.
 In this case, a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (the assigned value), unlike in BM.

 To point to a particle, we can either use the variables

\begin_inset Formula $x,t$
\end_inset

 since we know how 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 are related.
 Thus, one can write 
\begin_inset Formula $f(c,t)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,t)$
\end_inset

If you think that the two functions should be different, then the notation
 is confusing you.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,t)=f(t,x)$
\end_inset

 should help resolve.
 The position of the arguments is not important, this is not like a computer
 function.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,t)$
\end_inset

 is the statement that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x,t$
\end_inset

.
 That's it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Now we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right]_{c}=\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right]_{t}.\left[\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}\right]_{c}+\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right]_{q},
\]

\end_inset

where we used 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,t)$
\end_inset

 on the RHS.
 Note also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 refers to the velocity of a given particle, thus it must equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\partial q/\partial t\right]{}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Now for 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\int_{-\infty}^{q}\left|\psi(q')\right|^{2}dq'=c$
\end_inset

, the LHS disappears.
 Consequently, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}\right]_{c}=-\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right]_{q}/\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial q}\right]_{t},
\]

\end_inset

which is in a form which can be evaluated directly from the relation given.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\partial f/\partial q\right]_{t}=\left|\psi(q,t)\right|^{2}=R^{2}$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=Re^{iS/\hbar}$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to show that the probability current is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla S/m$
\end_inset

.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\partial\left|\psi(q,t)\right|/\partial t\right]_{q}=-\nabla.(R^{2}\nabla S/m)$
\end_inset

, which is effectively the probability conservation statement, derived from
 Schrodinger's equation, written in polar form, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\left[\partial f/\partial t\right]_{q}=R^{2}\nabla S$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}=\nabla S$
\end_inset

 as claimed.

\begin_layout Standard
An equation similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{p}$
\end_inset

 can be obtained and an appropriate dynamics can perhaps then be constructed.
 It may be mentioned as a remark that, quite independent of its motivation,
 this scheme can be used to compute Bohmian trajectories.
 It is much more efficient, as is apparent from a comparison of the resources
 required between computing an integral and the steps listed in

 We will see how non-multiplicativity gives rise to what one might confuse
 to mean contextuality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach is to take some compatible observables and to construct a `super-op
erator', a measurement of which can yield the values of all of these compatible
 observables in a single shot.
 We would see then, that the in-principle measurement outcome of observing
 these compatible operators, would not be consistent.
 Now this one might treat as contextuality, but according to the definition
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Peres-Mermin-Revisited"

\[
\hat{B}_{1}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}}=\left|00\right\rangle \left\langle 00\right|+\left|01\right\rangle \left\langle 01\right|-\left[\left|10\right\rangle \left\langle 10\right|+\left|11\right\rangle \left\langle 11\right|\right],
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{B}_{2}=\hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}=\left|10\right\rangle \left\langle 10\right|+\left|11\right\rangle \left\langle 11\right|-\left[\left|00\right\rangle \left\langle 00\right|+\left|01\right\rangle \left\langle 01\right|\right],
\]

\end_inset

while we define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{C}=f(\{\hat{B}_{i}\})=0.\left|00\right\rangle \left\langle 00\right|+1.\left|01\right\rangle \left\langle 01\right|+2.\left|10\right\rangle \left\langle 10\right|+3.\left|11\right\rangle \left\langle 11\right|.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 maybe viewed as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and other operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}$
\end_inset

 which are constructed to obtain a maximally commuting set.
 A measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

, will collapse the state into one of the states which are simultaneous
 eignkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, from the observed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

, one can deduce the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Now consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}\left|\chi\right\rangle =\left|10\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1})=1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{B}_{2})=1$
\end_inset

, using the discretely c-ingle theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Discretely-C-ingle-Theory"

\end_inset

), with 
\begin_inset Formula $c<0.5$
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C})=1$
\end_inset

, from which one can deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 was 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{2}$
\end_inset

 was 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 This property itself, one may be tempted call contextuality, viz.
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 depends on whether it is measured alone or with the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $\{B_{i}\}$
\end_inset

.
 However, it must be noted that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 has a well defined value, and so does 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus by our accepted definition, there's no contextuality.
 It is just that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(\hat{C})\neq f(m_{1}(\hat{B}_{1}),m_{1}(\hat{B}_{2}),\dots)$
\end_inset

, viz.
 the theory is non-multiplicative.
 Note that after measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 however, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}(\hat{B}_{1})=+1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}(\hat{B}_{2})=-1$
\end_inset

 (for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

) consistent with those deduced by measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Denouement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already learnt that the proof of `contextuality', in fact requires
 three assumptions, (1) multiplicativity, (2) non-contextuality and (3)
 non-invasiveness.
 Here we were able to construct an explicit non-contextual theory (for spins)
 which is non-multiplactive, but invasive and completely consistent with
 QM.
 Succinctly stated, it satisfies (2) but neither (3) nor (1), serving as
 a counter-example to the claim that non-contextual hidden variable theories
 can't be consistent with QM.
 We also showed how the theory might be misconstrued to be contextual and
 provided a clarification.
 This is of interest because, in BM, contextuality can arise from two sources,
 one is the PM situation and second is the measurement process.
 These two usually get misconstrued and have engendered confusion about
 the said notion.
