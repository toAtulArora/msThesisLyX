I acknowledge the contribution of my project guide, Prof. Arvind,
who provided me with an environment conducive to research, and motivation
to facilitate completion of this project. He encouraged independent
thinking and guided me through difficulties I encountered.

Discussions with the Quantum Computation \& Quantum Information (QCQI)
group members, especially those with Rajendra Bhati and Kishor Bharti
have been particularly efficacious. Inputs from Jaskaran Singh have
also been helpful. The QCQI group seminars, specifically, those by
Samridhi Gambhir and Dr. Arun Shehrawat, have helped narrowing the
thesis problem. 

Dr. Abhishek Choudhuri and Prof. Sudeshna Sinha, although formally
not related to the project, have been kind enough to assist me at
various instances with challenges I faced while numerically simulating
the equations. 

I am grateful to my parents and my colleagues/friends, who have been
pivotal to helping me maintain mental balance, inspired me and provided
emotional support, in ways they perhaps don't realize, specifically
Manu Jayadharan, Prashansa Gupta, Kishor Bharti, Ritu Roy Chowdhury,
Vivek Sagar, Yosman BapatDhar, Saumya Gupta, Shwetha Srinivasan, Evelyn
Abraham and Srijit Mukherjee.

I end with acknowledging Immanuel Kant, for his philosophical work
on ethics, which has heavily affected my thoughts, actions and outlook
to life.\selectlanguage{english}%
